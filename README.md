Deployment:
Hosted on Render

### üìñ How to Use
Visit the live demo: [MapFlow](https://mapflow.onrender.com)
Select a city from the provided options (e.g., Paris, Rome, Chicago). Larger cities require time to load and perform algorithms.

Click on two nodes to set your start and end points.
Start node: Highlighted in green.
End node: Highlighted in red.
Choose an algorithm.
Reset the graph or switch algorithms anytime.
